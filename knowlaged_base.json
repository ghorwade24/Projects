Security policies define the acceptable use of resources, access controls, data protection measures, and incident response procedures.",
      "Network Segmentation": "Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller subnetworks or segments to improve security and performance. By isolating different parts of the network, organizations can limit the impact of security breaches and control the flow of traffic to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "IDS": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. IDSs analyze network traffic, log files, and other data sources to detect and alert administrators about potential security threats.",
      "Data Breach": "A data breach is a security incident where sensitive, protected, or confidential data is accessed, stolen, or used by unauthorized individuals. This may involve personal information, financial data, intellectual property, or other sensitive data.",
      "Penetration Testing": "Penetration testing, also known as pen testing or ethical hacking, is a simulated cyber attack against a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by real attackers. It helps organizations assess their security posture and improve their defenses.",
      "Security Patch": "A security patch is a software update released by vendors to fix vulnerabilities or weaknesses in their products. These patches are designed to address specific security issues and protect users from known threats. It's important for organizations and individuals to regularly apply security patches to keep their systems secure.",
      "Cryptographic Hash Function": "A cryptographic hash function is a mathematical algorithm that converts an input (or 'message') into a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hexadecimal number. Hash functions are widely used in cryptography for data integrity verification, password hashing, digital signatures, and various other security applications."
